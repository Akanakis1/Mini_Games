# Python CLI Utilities — Core Programming Exercises

This repository contains a small set of Python command-line utilities designed to
demonstrate **core programming fundamentals**, including input validation,
control flow, looping logic, and basic state handling.

The projects are intentionally simple and focus on correctness and clarity
rather than advanced features.

---

## Project Purpose

This repository exists to demonstrate:
- reliable Python control flow,
- defensive input handling,
- structured CLI interaction,
- basic program state management.

It complements analytics-focused projects by showing solid programming foundations.

## Included Scripts

### Calculator — `Calculator.py`
A command-line calculator supporting:
- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
- numeric input validation,
- division-by-zero handling,
- formatted numeric output.

---

### Number Guessing Utility — `Number_Guessing_Game.py`
An interactive guessing utility that:
- selects a random integer within a fixed range,
- limits the number of attempts,
- provides directional feedback,
- allows graceful early exit.

---

### Rock–Paper–Scissors Utility — `Rock_Paper_Scissors.py`
A simple interactive script demonstrating:
- input validation against a fixed set of options,
- score tracking across rounds,
- loop control and termination conditions.
