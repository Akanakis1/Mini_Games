# Python Mini Projects (CLI)

A small collection of beginner-friendly **command-line Python projects** built to practice core programming concepts: input validation, control flow, loops, and basic game logic. The repository currently includes a calculator and two interactive games.

## Projects

### 1) Calculator
**File:** `Calculator.py`
A simple calculator that supports:
- Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`)
- Input validation for numeric values
- Division-by-zero handling
- Rounded output (4 decimals)

### 2) Number Guessing Game
**File:** `Number_Guessing_Game.py`
A guessing game where:
- The program selects a random number between 0 and 100
- The player has **10 attempts**
- The player can quit anytime by typing `exit`.
- Feedback is provided after each guess (too high/too low)

### 3) Rock, Paper, Scissors
**File:** `Rock_Paper_Scissors.py`
A classic rock-paper-scissors game versus the computer:
- Validates user input (rock/paper/scissors)
- Tracks score until you reach **+5** (win) or **-3** (lose)

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (works with standard library only)

### Run a project
From the repository folder:

```bash
python Calculator.py
python Number_Guessing_Game.py
python Rock_Paper_Scissors.py
