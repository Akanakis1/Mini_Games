# Python Projects Collection
This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects, each designed to showcase basic programming concepts and provide a fun and interactive experience.

## The projects include:

- Calculator.py: A basic calculator script allowing users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Number_Guessing_Game.py: An interactive number guessing game where the program selects a random number, and the player must guess it with feedback on whether the guess is too high or low.

- Rock_Paper_Scissors.py: A classic rock-paper-scissors game where the user competes against the computer, following the standard rules of the game.

Each project is part of the initial commit and serves as a foundation for improving programming skills with Python. Updates and additional projects will be added in the future.
