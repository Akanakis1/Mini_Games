# Python Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects, each designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts and provide a fun, interactive learning experience.

## The projects include:

- **Calculator.py**: A basic calculator script that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Number_Guessing_Game.py**: An interactive guessing game where the program selects a random number, and the player receives feedback on whether their guesses are too high or too low.
- **Rock_Paper_Scissors.py**: A console-based rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer using standard game rules.

Each project is part of the initial commit and serves as a foundation for building Python proficiency. Future updates will introduce new features and additional projects.
